The file "AdultCensus_crowdsourcing_data.csv" contains the crowdsourcing 
results for AdultCensus dataset.

It contains 3046 examples (y label ratio = 1:1), and each example has 
11 crowdsourcing answers.

The first line of a given CSV file contains the information of each 
column. The contents are as follows.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Meta features>
example_id: IDs for identifying each example
true_label: Whether one's actual annual income is above $50K (correct 
   answer, true y)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Features provided to crowdworkers>
age: Age (raw value)
work_class: A rough classification of occupational groups
education: Academic background
education_num: The numerical value of one's academic background
marital_status: Marital status. Note that "separated" includes people 
   who living apart with marital discord or intentions of a divorce, 
   "married-spouse-absent" includes married people who live apart because 
   they have different residences for reasons such as occupation.
occupation: More information about occupational groups
role_in_family: One's own role in the family
caiptal_gain: Capital gain (non-negative integer)
work_hours_per_week: Working hours a week
gender: Male and female
race: White and black
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Crowdsourcing results>
ans_1 ~ ans_11: Results from 11 unique workers. Probabilities of recidivism 
   within two years determined by each worker for the sample. (lowest:1, 
   highest: 4)
worker_id_1 ~ worker_id_11: ID assigned to each worker (converted value 
   of the AMT worker ID). The AMT worker ID is not disclosed for privacy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This data shows the results of crowdsourcing in true y label ratio 1:1.
In comparison, the validation set used in our experiments does not have
a y label ratio of 1:1 because we do not have knowledge of the true labels.
Instead, we take a random subset of the (unlabeled) training data and
crowdsource the labels, which preserves the original true label distribution.

To adjust the quality of crowdsourced labels, one can compute worker-specific
accuracies by grouping the answers by worker_id and filter out poor performers.
